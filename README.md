### RFID Door Lock System

It is a simple Door Lock system with added features including:

### Single User System
Once the single user system is selected, the system will prompt the user to enter the card that will be used for access...
After the card selection, the system is now ready...
  
### Multi User System:
For Multiple users, the system will prompt for available cards that will be necessary for access to the system.
Once the cards are registered in the system, the system is now ready...
  
### e-Registration:
e-Registration will be used to register the date and time of the cards that will be allowed access in the system.
e-Registration is the only thing that remains to be done...
  
### SleepGuard:
SleepGuard is a system where we can set a time(sleeptime) when the user wants absolutely no access to the system,
If somebody tries to gain access using either of the cards mc1 or mc2, the cards will be registered(no access will be granted)
and when the sleeptime is over and the first card is read, an alarm will ring prompting the user to check the system... 
Although other cards will not be allowed during sleeptime, master card will have full control...
  
###  Future aspirations:
1. Instead of an alarm for SleepGuard, whenever a card is registered during sleeptime a phonecall in the form of an alarm will be made to the user
of that card that it is right now in unauthorised hands...
